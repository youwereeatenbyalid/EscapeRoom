You stab into the pig with the knife trying to follow along the path of the stitching.
The smell of decomposing flesh assaults your nose.
After opening the stitching you stick your hand into the guts of the pig, feeling around as you force your hand further in.
You manage to feel something hard, different in texture from the guts and the bones.
Grabbing on to the object you yank it out of the pig, revealing a blood covered bronze key.

You obtained the bronze key.
