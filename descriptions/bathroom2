You take a look around the bathroom.
Most of the bathroom is in shambles and covered in mold and other plant life breaking through the walls.
The bathtub you were in is filled with half-melted ice, and the body floats inside it.
You spot a metal pipe on the floor most likely from the former plumbing of this place.
The only exit seems to be a wooden door to the north showing signs of aging that is currently closed.
