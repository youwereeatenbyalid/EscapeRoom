You look around the bedroom.
You can see aged and broken walls,
furniture that has begun to rot as well as a bed with broken support.
It is torn, and holes have been chewed in the mattress.
There is another door, but no door handle upon it.
There seems to be a protrusion pushing from inside the mattress.
