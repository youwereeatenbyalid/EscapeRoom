You look around the bedroom.
You can see aged and broken walls,
furniture that has begun to rot as well as a bed with broken support.
It is torn, and holes have been chewed in the mattress.
To the east is the kitchen.
There is another door to the south, but no door handle upon it.
There seems to be a protrusion pushing from inside the mattress.
