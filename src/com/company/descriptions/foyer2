You look around and take note of the extravagant foyer.
To the west, there are pillars of marble and a large torn red carpet that leads from the entrance doors to the stairs.
To the north is the exit you came through.
There are multiple urns and paintings that are either broken or rotted away.
Beside the door there appears to be an electrical box with a small green light.
