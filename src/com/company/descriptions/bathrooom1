You wake you with a startle, a wave of dizziness and and confusion run through your mind.
There is a lingering pain in your head and you canâ€™t seem to remember what has happened in the past few hours.
Trying to stand you start to see that you are not anywhere you recognize but rather inside what seems to be an aged and decrepit bathroom.
You appear to have been unconscious inside the bathtub. While getting out you feel your foot bump into something.
Submerged in the water and ice cubes, unmoving and covered in blood, is a body.
You feel a growing sense of dread, and realize that if you don't get out of here quickly, you'll be next.
